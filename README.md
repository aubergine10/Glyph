# Glyph v0.0.1 (experimental)

> Over 100 glyph icons in a font that can be used for button, label and frame captions.

![Example](http://i.imgur.com/3Rs1WWZ.png)

**Note: Due to a bug in earlier versions of Factorio, custom fonts only work with Factorio 0.14.3 and above.**

## Usage

This mod is still in experimental pre-alpha development. Don't use it for production use, but feel free to experiment with it and [leave feedback](https://github.com/aubergine10/Glyph/issues) :)

The mod adds a glyph font contianing numerous vector icons, along with a locale dictionary (`locale/en/dictionary.cfg`) allowing them to be referenced by name in your code.

### Adding dependency

The mod is designed to be a library, which other mods can depend on - this allows a single instance of the glyph font to be used by multiple mods.

In your mods' `info.json` add the dependency for both the Glyph mod and also the base mod (to make sure valid version of Factorio is being used), for example:

```
  "dependencies": ["Glyph >= 0.0.1","base >= 0.14.3"],
```

### Setting the font

Set the font in a prototype style sheet (see `core` and `base` mods for examples of that) or, at runtime, via the [`.style.font`](http://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/LuaStyle.html) property of a [LuaGuiElement](http://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/LuaGuiElement.html), for example:

```lua
game.players[1].gui.top.my_gui_element.style.font = 'glyph-large'
```

Four font sizes are currently provided:

* `glyph-small` - 12pt text
* `glyph` - 14pt text
* `glyph-medium` - 16pt text
* `glyph-large` - 18pt text

You can add additional sizes - see `prototypes/fonts.lua` for example.

### Choosing the glyph

After downloading the mod, unzip it and open the `reference.htm` in a browser to display a handy chart listing all the glyphs and their associated [locale keys](http://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/Concepts.html#LocalisedString).

To display a glyph, set `yourElement.caption` to the relevant key for the icon you want, for example:

```lua
game.players[1].gui.top.my_gui_element.caption = { 'glyph-biter' }
```

## License

The .lua, .cfg and .json files were made by me (aubergine) and are MIT licensed.

The font was built using [Fontastic](http://fontastic.me/), a site that allows glyphs from numerous open source fonts (and a few commerical ones, which aren't used for obvious reasons) to be merged in to a single font file with custom character code mappings.

Glyphs are from the following fonts:

* [Ionicons2](https://github.com/driftyco/ionicons) - [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
* [Octicons](https://github.com/primer/octicons) - [SIL OFL 1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL)

The reference.htm and associated .css were automatically created by Fontastic, and subsequently edited by me. As far as I can tell, those files are MIT licensed, although the Fontastic app doesn't specifically state that in the files themselves.

## Contributing

Yes please! In particular I could use some help with:

* general testing, feedback, improvements
* merging glyphs in to vanilla fonts
* easier way to maintain the locale dictionary (maybe by parsing the reference.htm to autogenerate the dictionary?)
* custom Factorio-related glyphs in SVG format can be added to the font

Ping me via the issue tracker if you want to discuss, or just send pull requests :)

## Future plans

* Move all glyphs to [private unicode space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas) (`U+E000`â€“`U+F8FF`)
* Merge with vanilla fonts so that glyphs and normal text can be used together
* Add more glyphs based on feedback (possibly remove some too)
* Maybe add remote interface with list of supported glyphs?
* Add demo script that populates a simple grid with all available glyphs?
* Add additional open source fonts, such as LCD, dot matrix, etc.
